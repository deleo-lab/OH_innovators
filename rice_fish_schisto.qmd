In regions hyperendemic to schistosomiasis, communities need intervention beyond mass drug administration and short-term snail controls. That's where rice-fish co-aquaculture comes in as biological snail control. Native fish species naturally consume snails while simultaneously providing farmers with protein, additional income, and natural fertilizer. Rice-fish co-aquaculture is a low external input sustainable agriculture system (LEISA). Farmers need only slightly modify their existing fields and purchase fish; no external feeding of fish is required. Furthermore, fish waste enriches the soil and reduces pesticide needs. In high-risk regions like the Senegal River Basin, pilot studies show farmers recoup their investment in year one while snail populations plummet.
